"##Kinesthetic Astronomy https://www.spacescience.org/eduresources/kinesthetic.php is an excellent approach to develop these models.  Students should be expected to develop this model at a significantly more rigorous level than they might in previous grades. For example, the relationship of lunar orbits to solar orbits and Earth’s rotation should be examined in some detail. This is a fertile ground for misconceptions. Students should also be pressed to explain seasonal changes in sky observations.  Students should make direct observations of the sky, but also can use virtual planetarium apps to add to their data and to evaluate seasonal changes in a timely way. ######
