The subject matter of physics includes mechanics, heat, light and other radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism, and the structure of atoms. There are branches like nuclear physics, astrophysics, solid state physics and interdisciplinary studies undertaken by biophysicists.  The introduction should address the kinds of questions that physics answers and be an advance organizer for what is to come.###

Where do we get it from?#Analysing and Interpreting Data (9-12): Analyze data using tools, technologies, and/or models (e.g., computational, mathematical) in order to make valid and reliable scientific claims or determine an optimal design solution.#"Many things in the material world are in motion, need to be kept warm, kept cold, lit, produce sounds or communicate with others. To do any of these requires a source of fuel. What is the source of fuel that keeps a car going, a plane flying, keeps us going, or lights our street?

How do the sources of fuel produce what is needed to make these machines work and keep us warm? Scientists have discovered that this question is best answered by introducing an idea that all fuels are all a source of energy and that, when transferred, this energy can help to work machines and heat objects. 

Energy can either be stored or it can be transferred.  Stored energy can be transferred to other stores by doing work.

Energy can be counted in units called joules. The food we eat has a label on it showing how much energy each 100g of that food will provide.The fuel itself, however, does not have energy. It is the combination of the fuel and oxygen that releases the energy. Energy can also be released by converting matter to a form of energy.  So, energy is released when we burn gas in an oven, when we respire in our cells and ‘burn’ glucose in our cells, or when the petrol in our cars is combined with oxygen and burnt in the engine. ‘How do we measure energy though?’ Energy is an abstract concept it is essentially an accounting mechanism. We cannot touch it but we can count it. One unit of energy is transferred when a force of 1 newton is exerted over a distance of 1 metre. This is called 1 Joule of energy."#"

The interesting thing is that whenever we do count it, we find that there is the same amount before and after. This pattern is called the law of conservation of energy. It has never been shown to be incorrect so we cannot get more energy out of a system then we put in.

‘So, if energy is conserved, why do we worry about running out of it?’ Energy can spread out, however, so that it is less useful. A million dollars in a suitcase is a useful sum of money. Dropped out of a skyscraper window to the street below, it is less useful as it has spread out. It is still $1 million though.

This is why we worry about ‘running out of energy’. What we are really worrying about is running out of concentrated sources of energy such as gas, oil and nuclear fuel. The sun itself, in contrast, will exist for another 5000 million years so it will be a long time before that runs out."###

There are many different types of waves. There are sound waves, ultrasound waves, radio waves and light waves. In addition, X-rays, infrared and ultraviolet are waves as well.

‘How then do we describe waves?’ Waves have some basic properties. First, there is the distance between one wave and the next which we call the ‘wavelength’; then there is the size of the wave called the ‘amplitude’ and the number of waves produced in a second which is called the ‘frequency’; finally, there is the speed at which the wave moves which we call the ‘velocity’ of the wave. The frequency is measured in a unit called Hertz, Hz for short. A frequency of 1 Hz means that one wave a second is produced."###
